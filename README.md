Welcome to the Student Dashboard Project!

On this website, students and teachers have the ability to choose class cohorts by date to view details about the student's performance. Whether it's checking for someone's birthday or seeing if one is on track to graduate, the Student Dashboard Project has it all. Users can access one's email, personal note's from teachers,  and even their grades from CodeWar, in class projects, and IR/LPD assignments. And if you feel like you want to leave a student a message, that option is also available. To access the site, just click on the link, https://darling-genie-d60c2b.netlify.app/ and have fun.
